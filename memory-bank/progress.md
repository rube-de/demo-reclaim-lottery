# Progress

## What Works
* Contract with configurable maxParticipants  
* Complete lottery lifecycle (start/enter/end/pickWinner/reset)
* Prize deposit and distribution system
* Comprehensive view functions:
  - getParticipants()
  - getParticipantCount()  
  - getLotteryDetails()
* Full test coverage for all functionality

## What's Left to Build
1. Document security considerations (esp. randomness).
2. Prepare deployment scripts/instructions.
3. (Optional) Gas optimization analysis.
4. (Optional) Frontend integration examples.
5. (Optional) Formal security audit.

## Current Status
* Core contract fully implemented
* All main features complete
* Comprehensive test coverage
* Ready for production deployment

## Known Issues
* None yet - all initial tests passing

## Evolution of Project Decisions
* Changed from Ownable constructor with initial owner to default Ownable pattern
* Added ReentrancyGuard early for future security
