# Progress

## What Works
* Contract with configurable maxParticipants  
* Complete lottery lifecycle (start/enter/end/pickWinner/reset)
* Prize deposit and distribution system
* Comprehensive view functions:
  - getParticipants()
  - getParticipantCount()  
  - getLotteryDetails()
* Full test coverage for all functionality

## What's Left to Build
1. Enhanced frontend integration
2. Additional security audits
3. Gas optimization analysis
4. Production deployment setup

## Current Status
* Core contract fully implemented
* All main features complete
* Comprehensive test coverage
* Ready for production deployment

## Known Issues
* None yet - all initial tests passing

## Evolution of Project Decisions
* Changed from Ownable constructor with initial owner to default Ownable pattern
* Added ReentrancyGuard early for future security
