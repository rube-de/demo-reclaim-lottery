# Progress

## What Works
* Contract with configurable maxParticipants
* All entry validation tests passing
* Proper participant limit enforcement
* Tests for different maxParticipants values
* Prize deposit functionality implemented
* Owner-only deposit enforcement
* Prize amount accumulation working

## What's Left to Build
1. Implement `endLottery()` function
2. Implement `pickWinner()` functionality
3. Add prize distribution tests  
4. Implement `resetLottery()` function
5. Complete remaining test coverage

## Current Status
* Core contract structure complete
* Participant management working
* Prize deposit functionality implemented
* Ready for lottery conclusion logic

## Known Issues
* None yet - all initial tests passing

## Evolution of Project Decisions
* Changed from Ownable constructor with initial owner to default Ownable pattern
* Added ReentrancyGuard early for future security
