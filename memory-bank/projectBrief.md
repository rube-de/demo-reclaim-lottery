# Project Brief: Decentralized Lottery Smart Contract

## 1. Overview
- **Description:** Develop a secure and transparent decentralized lottery smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract will allow users to participate in a lottery, with a winner randomly selected by the contract owner.
- **Background:** Decentralized lotteries offer transparency and fairness by leveraging blockchain technology. This contract aims to provide a secure and auditable lottery system.
- **Target Audience:** Users interested in participating in a decentralized lottery, and the contract owner managing the lottery.

## 2. Objectives & Goals
- Create a smart contract that allows users to enter a lottery.
- Implement a mechanism to randomly select a winner.
- Ensure only unique addresses can participate.
- Provide functions for the owner to start, end, and reset the lottery.
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all contract functions.
- Success criteria: The contract should be deployed and function correctly on a test network, and all tests should pass.

## 3. Technical Specifications
- **Programming Languages:** Solidity
- **Frameworks/Tools:** Hardhat, OpenZeppelin
- **Environment:** Node.js, npm, VS Code with Solidity extension
- **APIs & Integrations:** None
- **Dependencies:** `@openzeppelin/contracts`, `hardhat`, `chai`, `ethers`

## 4. Tasks & Deliverables
1. **Task Title:** Implement Lottery Contract Structure
   - **Description:** Create the basic structure of the smart contract, including state variables for participants, owner, lottery status, and a set to ensure unique addresses.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Contract compiles without errors, and basic state variables are defined.
   - **Priority & Timeline:** High, First task.
   - **Additional Notes:** Use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` and `EnumerableSet` libraries.

2. **Task Title:** Implement `enter()` Function
   - **Description:** Allow users to enter the lottery, ensuring each address can only enter once.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The `enter()` function adds unique addresses to the participants set, and emits an event upon successful entry.
   - **Priority & Timeline:** High, Second task.
   - **Additional Notes:** Handle cases where the lottery is not active or an address has already entered.

3. **Task Title:** Implement `startLottery()` Function
   - **Description:** Allow the owner to start the lottery.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The `startLottery()` function sets the lottery status to active and emits an event.
   - **Priority & Timeline:** High, Third Task.
   - **Additional Notes:** Only the owner should be able to call this function.

4. **Task Title:** Implement `endLottery()` and `pickWinner()` Functions
   - **Description:** Allow the owner to end the lottery and randomly select a winner.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The `endLottery()` function sets the lottery status to inactive, and `pickWinner()` selects a random winner and transfers the lottery prize.
   - **Priority & Timeline:** High, Fourth Task.
   - **Additional Notes:** Use `keccak256` and block timestamp for randomness. Handle cases where there are no participants.

5. **Task Title:** Implement `resetLottery()` Function
   - **Description:** Allow the owner to reset the lottery, clearing all participants and resetting the lottery status.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The `resetLottery()` function clears the participants set and resets the lottery status.
   - **Priority & Timeline:** Medium, Fifth task.
   - **Additional Notes:** Only the owner should be able to call this function.

6. **Task Title:** Write Unit Tests
   - **Description:** Write comprehensive unit tests for all contract functions using Hardhat and Chai.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** All unit tests pass, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.
   - **Priority & Timeline:** High, Sixth Task.
   - **Additional Notes:** Test for correct functionality, security, and gas efficiency.

## 5. Timeline & Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** Basic contract structure and `enter()` function implemented.
- **Milestone 2:** `startLottery()`, `endLottery()`, and `pickWinner()` functions implemented.
- **Milestone 3:** `resetLottery()` function implemented.
- **Milestone 4:** Comprehensive unit tests written and passing.
- **Milestone 5:** Contract deployment and testing on a test network.

## 6. Additional Requirements
- **Security:** Ensure the contract is secure against common vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy).
- **Gas Efficiency:** Optimize the contract for gas efficiency.
- **Code Style:** Follow Solidity best practices and code style guidelines.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear and concise comments within the code.
- **Testing:** Ensure thorough testing of all functions.
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are required before deployment.

## 7. Questions & Clarifications
- Should there be a fee for entering the lottery?
- How should the prize distribution work?
- Is there a maximum number of participants?
- What test network should be used for deployment?
