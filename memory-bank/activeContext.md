# Active Context

## Current Focus
* Documentation updates completed
* Preparing to implement endLottery/pickWinner functionality

## Recent Changes
* Implemented and tested depositPrize() functionality
* Updated all documentation to current state
* Added comprehensive test coverage for:
  - Owner-only deposit enforcement
  - Prize amount accumulation
  - Event emissions
* Fixed documentation inconsistencies

## Next Steps
1. Implement endLottery() function
2. Develop pickWinner() with randomness
3. Add comprehensive test coverage
4. Document randomness approach limitations

## Active Decisions & Considerations
* Using call() instead of transfer() for prize payouts
* Need to document pseudo-randomness limitations
* Considering adding participant count view function

## Active Decisions & Considerations
* Using OpenZeppelin's EnumerableSet for participant tracking
* Implementing ReentrancyGuard for prize distribution safety
* Using block.timestamp/prevrandao for pseudo-randomness (with clear documentation of limitations)

## Important Patterns & Preferences
* Following TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor)
* Using NatSpec documentation throughout
* Adhering to Solidity style guide from .clinerules

## Learnings & Insights
* Need to be explicit about pseudo-randomness limitations in documentation
* Prize distribution will use call() instead of transfer() for better compatibility
