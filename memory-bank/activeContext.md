# Active Context

## Current Focus
* Finalizing documentation before moving to deployment preparation.
* Decision made to skip gas optimization for now.

## Recent Changes
* Completed implementation of all core lottery functions (start, enter, deposit, end, pickWinner, reset).
* Added view functions (getParticipants, getParticipantCount, getLotteryDetails).
* Ensured comprehensive test coverage for all implemented features.
* Updated all memory bank files to reflect current state.
* Reviewed potential gas optimizations and decided against implementing them at this stage.

## Next Steps
1. Document security considerations, especially pseudo-randomness.
2. Prepare deployment scripts and instructions.
3. Consider frontend integration examples.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
* Gas optimization deferred to prioritize core functionality completion.
* Sticking with `call()` for prize transfer due to safety.
* Pseudo-randomness approach (block variables) accepted for demo purposes, needs clear documentation.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
* Using OpenZeppelin's EnumerableSet for participant tracking
* Implementing ReentrancyGuard for prize distribution safety
* Using block.timestamp/prevrandao for pseudo-randomness (with clear documentation of limitations)

## Important Patterns & Preferences
* Following TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor)
* Using NatSpec documentation throughout
* Adhering to Solidity style guide from .clinerules

## Learnings & Insights
* Need to be explicit about pseudo-randomness limitations in documentation
* Prize distribution will use call() instead of transfer() for better compatibility
