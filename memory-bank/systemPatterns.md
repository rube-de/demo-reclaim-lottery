# System Patterns

## System Architecture

*   Provide a high-level overview of the system's architecture (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Layered, Event-Driven).
*   Include diagrams (Mermaid preferred) if helpful to visualize components and interactions.
*   Describe the main components and their responsibilities.

## Key Technical Decisions

*   Document significant architectural choices and their rationale (e.g., choice of database, communication protocols, major frameworks).
*   Why were these decisions made? What alternatives were considered?

## Design Patterns in Use

*   List key design patterns employed in the codebase (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Dependency Injection).
*   Where are they used and why?

## Component Relationships

*   Describe how major components or modules interact with each other.
*   Define key interfaces or contracts between components.

## Critical Implementation Paths

*   Outline the flow for critical user journeys or core system processes.
*   Highlight any complex or particularly important sequences of operations.
